title: Proven ways to make your website accessible in 2023
---

Web accessibility communities and tools keep evolving with time: if in 2009 we would refer to accessibility being tied to the HTML and some of the good practices widely known, in 2023 the picture is broader.

Accessibility in 2023 touches many aspects: copywriting, content creation, UX testing and interviews with people with disabilities, accessibility-first design systems and specs are being created by design teams. Developers are required to be involved not only in keeping up to date with best practices in modern frameworks, but also be ready for a11y testing (end-to-end, unit, and manual with assistive technology), performance, security. More clients and project managers are aware of accessibility and demand high standards. At the same time, it has never been easier to get accessibility training and establish bullet-proof practices in teams.
