# See you in 2023!

We had a blast in 2022 and we were super happy to see you all in person again after 3 years. So based on this experience, we're coming back in 2023 with a **two-day event**, a format that used to be our way to go in a pre-pandemic world.

Want to speak at JSHeroes? Read more about **[the call for papers process](/speak-at-jsheroes)** and submit your proposal.

**Tickets** will be available starting December! Looking forward to seeing you all back in Cluj, on the **18th** and **19th** of **May 2023**!
