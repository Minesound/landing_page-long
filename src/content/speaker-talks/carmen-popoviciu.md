title: Machine Learning at the Edge
---

A few years ago, developing Machine Learning with JavaScript would have seemed like a daunting and far fetched thing, and yet, libraries such as TensorFlow.js changed everything and made it all possible. Similarly, edge computing has been on its own trajectory to expand the JS ecosystem boundaries. With JS serverless functions now running at the edge, JavaScript developers have access to unprecedented tooling to express their creativity.

In this talk we will explore how all these tools can be combined together to further expand the ecosystem, and enable JavaScript developers to run Machine Learning at the edge. We will discuss what such a system would entail, its benefits, limitations, and the performance aspects of it. We will also walk through some real-world use cases that would benefit from such an approach, and do a live demo of some sample applications to better exemplify these concepts, and hopefully inspire you.
