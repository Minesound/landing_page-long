title: "Container Queries: The next step towards a truly modular CSS"
---

Modular, componentized frameworks and libraries are more popular than ever, but currently screen size is the only dimensional constraint to which a web design can adapt to. Luckily for us, great things are a foot.

Container Queries, which allow you to style elements based on their ancestors dimensions, a feature requested by many since the advent of component-based front-end architectures met the principles of responsive webdesign, is finally in active development.

In this talk, Maarten will explain what Container Queries are and show you how each component can adapt its design to the dimensions of its container. Join us on our journey towards a more modular CSS!
