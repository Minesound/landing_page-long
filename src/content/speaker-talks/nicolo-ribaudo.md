title: "JavaScript Modules: Past, Present, and Future"
---

For decades, JavaScript developers have relied on a multitude of module systems to organize and share code. But in 2015, ECMAScript finally introduced built-in standard semantics for modules, providing a long-awaited solution for the language. While ECMAScript modules have quickly become a popular format for writing code, most published code is still compiled to a single bundle or to a legacy module system.

The TC39 committee, which designs the ECMAScript language, is actively exploring this design space: are there any missing functionalities compared to previous systems? Do JavaScript developers need any capabilities that the language does not currently provide? What problems do ECMAScript modules currently cause?

This talk will walk you through the answers to those questions and show you current developments, giving a sneak peek at possible future modules features!
