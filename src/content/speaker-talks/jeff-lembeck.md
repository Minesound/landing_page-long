---

Our jobs are increasingly stressful, the growing complexity of what is being asked is a heavy burden, the dream of democratized access to the web is being challenged, our coworkers are being laid off and we need to find a way to do more with less-- and for some reason, our website is slower than it used to be. So, what do we do?

The best we can.

Let’s look at some common pitfalls facing engineers today focusing specifically on web performance and discuss how engineering leaders can find where to concentrate to get through these challenges, and how they can influence others to adapt along with them. We’ll find some quick wins and ways to make sure that, out of all that’s on your plate, this is one less thing to worry about.
