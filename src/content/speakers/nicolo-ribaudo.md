 I’m a developer who loves open source and JavaScript. I work at Igalia, where I help push the web forward, and I maintain Babel — the JavaScript compiler. I’m also a TC39 delegate and I’ve helped developing different JavaScript proposals over the years. When offline, I’m a math student in Turin, Italy.
