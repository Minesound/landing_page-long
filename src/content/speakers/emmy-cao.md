Hi! I'm Emmy and I'm a Developer Advocate at Wix. I started coding because of my childhood video game obsession, and taught myself web development while studying psychology in college. I love web development because a site on the internet feels like a house in a town - it's fun seeing what spaces exist for people to visit! Outside work hours, I love longboarding, playing guitar, and going to bookstores.
