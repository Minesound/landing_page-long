If I say 'Use', you say 'the Platform' ! Together with his fellow front end developers, Maarten raises iO's HTML, JavaScript and CSS bar to a whole new level. Proficient with tools such as Vue.js, Nuxt.js and OpenAPI and many others in his proverbial tool belt, he builds for a high performant, accessible and user-friendly web. Next to grinding keys, he's also a passionate tattler about how Open Source software should get more recognition, as it is the cornerstone of our current-day digital society.
