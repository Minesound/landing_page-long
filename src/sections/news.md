# See you in 2023!

We had a blast <a href="https://2022.jsheroes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in 2022</a> and we were super happy to see you all in person again after 3 years. So based on this experience, we're coming back in **2023** with a **two-day event**, a format that used to be our way to go in a pre-pandemic world.

**Tickets** are available on [our ti.to page](https://ti.to/jsheroes/2023). If PayPal is not your preferred payment method, you can also pay by invoice. For more information drop us a line at <a href="mailto:welcome@jsheroes.io">welcome@jsheroes.io</a>.

Looking forward to seeing you all back in Cluj, on the **18th** and **19th** of **May 2023**!
