2023 is a big year for us, as are planning our first two day event after the pandemic started. While 2022 was a great event, it was a single day conference, with most of the speakers re-invited after the cancellation of the 2020 event. Hence, 2023 is also the first year we brought back the call for papers.

For 2023 we decided to use sessionize for the operational part.
